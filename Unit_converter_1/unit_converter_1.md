# Unit Converter

This lab will involve writing a program that allows the user to convert a number between units.

## Version 1

Ask the user for the number of feet, and print out the equivalent distance in meters. Hint: 1 ft is 0.3048 m. So we can get the output in meters by **multiplying the input distance by 0.3048**. Below is an example of how you should structure your function: 

```python
def unit_converter():
    - input: "what is the distance in feet?" 12
    - return : "<initial value> <units> is <converted amount> <units>"
```

Example:

12 ft is 3.6576 m
